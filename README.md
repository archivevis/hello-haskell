# hello-haskell
 A repository uploaded as part of MLH's Local Hack Day: Share event. Actually done as part of two challenges - "Hello, World in a New Language" ~~look, the event starts at 2am! I'm asleep at that time!~~ and "Set up a Project on GitHub".

## Building
  Make sure you have [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/platform/) installed. On Windows/some Linux distributions, this will be easy, on Arch Linux, make sure you install the `ghc-static` package. On a terminal open in the directory, run 
  ```
  $ ghc helloworld.hs
  ```
  then, after it finishes compiling, run
  ```
  $ ./helloworld
  ```
